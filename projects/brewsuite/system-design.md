# System Design Document: BrewSuite

## Overview
BrewSuite is a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform designed to digitalize coffee shop operations. It includes a Progressive Web App (PWA) for customers to place orders, an Operation Management System, and an Admin Portal, both of which leverage Next.js for full-stack capabilities. This document outlines the architecture, key components, and technology stack for BrewSuite.

## System Architecture Overview

### Architecture Style
**Monolithic Full-Stack Architecture**: 
- Each system (Operation Management System and Admin Portal) is built using Next.js to handle both client-side and server-side functionalities within a single codebase.
- The Customer Order App is developed as a PWA using React, interfacing through APIs managed by the Operation Management System.

### Key Components

1. **Customer Order App (PWA)**
   - **Technologies**: React, Service Workers
   - **Functionality**: Provides an engaging, responsive interface for order placement, menu browsing, and order status tracking.

2. **Operation Management System (Next.js)**
   - **Technologies**: Next.js
   - **Functionality**: Facilitates order processing, transaction management, and inventory control with a unified user interface and backend capabilities.

3. **Admin Portal (Next.js)**
   - **Technologies**: Next.js
   - **Functionality**: Offers administrative features for client management, billing, and system monitoring, also encapsulating both UI and backend.

## Component Design

### Customer Order App (PWA)
- **Technologies**: 
  - React for frontend logic.
  - Service Workers for offline capability and push notifications.
- **Functionality**: 
  - Provides a seamless user experience for viewing and ordering from the menu and tracking order status via APIs.

### Operation Management System
- **Technologies**: 
  - Next.js for integrated frontend and backend processing.
- **Functionality**:
  - Manages orders, inventory updates, and transactions, with backend functionality handled through Next.js API routes.

### Admin Portal
- **Technologies**: 
  - Next.js for full-stack applications.
- **Functionality**: 
  - Handles client onboarding, account management, billing, and system health checks using server actions and functions native to Next.js.

## Database
- **Type**: 
  - Unified RDBMS or Document Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for consistent data access.
- **Data Model**: 
  - Schemas for managing users, orders, inventory, transactions, and client information.

## Security
- **Authentication**: 
  - Employ JWTs or session-based strategies for secure access control managed within Next.js.
- **Data Security**: 
  - Encrypt data and ensure secure exchanges with HTTPS.

## Monitoring and Logging
- **Tools**: 
  - Set up monitoring via services like Prometheus, Grafana, or Elastic Stack for detailed oversight.
- **Purpose**: 
  - Ensure real-time visibility into performance metrics, system health, and application logs.

## Conclusion
This system design document consolidates the architecture leveraging Next.js for both the Operation Management System and the Admin Portal. This strategy simplifies development and facilitates integrated UI and backend logic, offering a scalable foundation for BrewSuite.
