# Epic 1: Client Management

## Initial MVP User Stories

### **User Story 1.1**
As an admin, I want to onboard new clients easily, so that the platform can grow efficiently.

- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
  - Admin can input basic client details (e.g., business name, contact, and location) to register new clients.
  - System generates and provides default login credentials for new clients.
  - Successful confirmation notification upon account creation.
- **Tasks:**
  1. **Design Client Registration Form**:
      - Create a basic form UI in the Next.js application to collect essential client details (e.g., business name, contact info).
      - Implement form validation to ensure required fields are filled.
  2. **Set Up API Endpoint for Client Registration**:
      - Develop an API route in Next.js to handle form submissions and client data processing.

  3. **Implement Backend Logic for Client Onboarding**:
      - Write logic to validate incoming client data and generate default credentials.
      - Save new client information to the database, ensuring data integrity.

  4. **Feedback Mechanism Post-Submission**:
      - Provide user notifications (e.g., success messages) upon successful registration or error alerts if processes fail.

### **User Story 1.2**:
As an admin, I want to view a list of all client accounts, so that I can quickly access client information.

- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
  - Admin can see a list view of all registered clients with essential details like business name and contact status.
  - Ability to search and filter client list by name or status for quicker access.

- **Tasks:**
 1. **Develop Client List UI**:
    - Design a user interface that renders a list of clients, enabling easy browsing and search functionality.

 2. **Create API Endpoint for Fetching Client Data**:
    - Set up an API route in Next.js to retrieve a list of clients from the database.

 3. **Integrate Client Data with UI**:
    - Fetch data from the API within the frontend and render it in a list component.
    - Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for better data handling if necessary.

 4. **Implement Search and Filter Functionality**:
    - Enable searching clients by names or filtering based on their status.


### **User Story 1.3**
As an admin, I want to edit existing client details, so that client information can be kept up-to-date.

- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
  - Admin can update existing client details such as contact information and account status.
  - Changes to client information are saved and reflected accurately in the client list.

- **Tasks:**
 1. **Design Client Detail/Edit UI**:
    - Create a UI component that displays existing client details and allows for editing.

 2. **API Endpoint for Updating Client Data**:
    - Develop an API route to receive and process updates to client details.

 3. **Implement Update Logic**:
    - Write backend logic that validates updates and safely modifies client records in the database.

 4. **UI Feedback for Changes**:
    - Display confirmation notifications upon successful update or alert users to address error messages.

 5. **Test Edit Functionality**:
    - Ensure edited details reflect accurately in both the data storage and client lists.


## Additional Considerations

- **Testing**: Each task should include writing unit tests and integration tests where applicable to ensure reliability.
- **Security**: Implement necessary security checks, such as validating input on submission endpoints and securing API routes.
- **Documentation**: Document the codebase, APIs, and usage instructions as you progress to aid future development and onboarding.
